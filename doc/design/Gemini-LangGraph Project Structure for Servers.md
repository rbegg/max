## Prompt:
outline a typical langgraph project structure using mcp for multiple servers

## Response:
Here is a file outlining a typical project structure for a distributed `langgraph` application using the `langgraph-mcp` (Multi-Consumer/Producer) setup, which is designed for multiple servers.

This structure effectively separates the concerns of your application:

*   **Graph Logic (`graph_def.py`, `nodes/`)**: Defines _what_ to do.
*   **Shared State (`config.py`)**: Defines _how_ to communicate.
*   **Entrypoint (`producer_server.py`)**: Defines _when_ to start.
*   **Workforce (`consumer_worker.py`)**: Defines _who_ does the work.

This allows you to scale your `consumer_worker.py` instances across as many servers as you need to handle the processing load, while the `producer_server.py` just handles the lightweight job of starting new graphs.

## Prompt:
for clarity i meant model context protocol, for example with a neo4j and google calendar access

## Response:
Thank you for the clarification! That's a key distinction.

You are correct: "MCP" can stand for **Model Context Protocol**, which is an open-source standard for connecting LLMs to external tools and data, much like a "USB-C for AI." This is a different concept from the `langgraph-mcp` library for _distributed execution_ (Multi-Consumer/Producer) that I initially outlined.

Given your interest in the **Model Context Protocol** and integrating tools like Neo4j and Google Calendar, the project structure is less about multiple _worker servers_ running the _same_ graph and more about a central **MCP Host** (your LangGraph agent) communicating with multiple, independent **MCP Servers** (your tools).

Here is a new file that outlines a project structure based on this "Model Context Protocol" architecture, and also contrasts it with the more common "in-process" tool integration.
